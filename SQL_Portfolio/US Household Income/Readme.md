# U.S. Household Income Data Analysis (MySQL Project)

This project explores and analyzes U.S. household income data using SQL. It leverages two datasets: one containing geographical and demographic data, and the other with statistical income data.

## Objectives
- Clean and explore income-related data by U.S. city and state.
- Join and analyze relationships between land, income, and geography.
- Identify top income locations and potential outliers.
- Check for missing values and prepare clean views for reporting.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- SQL joins, aggregation, and filtering.
- Data cleaning and quality checks.
- Analytical queries to extract business insights.
- Creation of SQL views for simplified reporting.

## Sample Insights
- Top 10 cities by mean income.
- States with the largest land and water areas.
- Correlation between land size and income levels.
- Cities with unusually high income variation (standard deviation).
- Percentage of missing data in key columns.

## Data Tables
- `us_household_income`
- `us_household_income_statistics`

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- SQL Window/Aggregation Functions
- Views for simplified data access

## Files
- `us_income_analysis.sql` – Main SQL script with all analysis steps and comments
- (Optional) `income_view.sql` – SQL View for quick access to cleaned dataset
